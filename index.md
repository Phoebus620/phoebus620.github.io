## Welcome to My Homepage

This is the first attempt at website making. I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Phoebus620/phoebus620.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

And I'd like to show something about myself to you.

### Personal Information

I'm a Master from NJU in Nanjing, China. I want to tell you about

```markdown
What am I studying for

Which program am I doing

What do I want to eat tonight

blabla
```

Besides, these sentences above are all shown by Markdown, which is a machine language I haven't master well. You can find more details at [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Something Else

I don't know what should I say but I think I can try to use  `Markdown` again.

### Here Is the Evidence that I Can Speak Chinese

我爱你！
